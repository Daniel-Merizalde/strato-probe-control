## Strato probe control

This set of python files were developed on 2020 to control a semi automatic robotic probe designed to go into foundation pile holes and make 3D scans of them using a RPLidar A1. The repository contains several files used both for controlling the semi automatic probe and capturing the 3D dot cloud data when it is inside of the foundation pile hole.
The main file for interactions with the Lidar sensor is data_capture.py, while the control interface GUI can be found at sonda_gui.py.
